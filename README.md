## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of React Native with native mobile technologies: Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS. The aim is to provide a simple yet effective example of how to connect React Native components with native functionalities, enhancing the performance and capabilities of your mobile applications.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration:** Easily call native modules from React Native.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Sample implementations for both Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift).
- **Real-World Use Cases:** Examples showcasing practical applications of the bridge.
